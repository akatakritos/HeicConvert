# HEIC Converter

I was trying to help a family member move a bunch of photos off an iPhone.

Doing so created a bunch of `.heic` format image, which her windows
computer doesn't know how to handle.

There's a bunch of costly, ad-ridden, confusing apps out there that
can bulk convert HEIC to JPG. 

I wanted my own. It also gave me a place to play with Akka.net and Avalonia.

## Tech

Image conversions through
[LibHeif.Sharp](https://github.com/0xC0000054/libheif-sharp) and
[ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp).
